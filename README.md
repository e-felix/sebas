# SEBAS

Sebas is a general purpose tool which aims to help (me at least) automate tasks per application project.
I mainly work on projects which are based of framework with dotenv and cli commands. The main goal is to allow me to switch configuration as I please without having the comment/uncomment/modify variables or write commands by hand

> Why Sebas ? Because I need my own personal butler :D
